🌼 Flower Species Image Classifier
This project is a Deep Learning Image Classifier designed to identify different flower species. It leverages PyTorch for model building and training, offering support for several architectures such as VGG16, ResNet101, and AlexNet.

The model is trained on a dataset of flower images and can predict the species of flowers given new images, along with the top probabilities for the predictions.

🚀 Features
Multiple Architectures: Supports VGG16, ResNet101, AlexNet, and a custom architecture.
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models for improved performance.
Checkpointing: Save and resume training seamlessly.
Device Compatibility: Train and infer on GPU or CPU.
Metrics Tracking: Training/validation losses and accuracy tracking.
Top-K Prediction: Provides probabilities for the top-K most likely classes.
Customizable Training: Configurable hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classifier.git
cd flower-classifier
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have PyTorch installed. Follow PyTorch installation instructions.

🏋️‍♀️ Training the Model
Prepare the Dataset: Ensure your dataset directory has the following structure:

bash
Copy code
data/
├── train/
├── valid/
└── test/
Run the Training Script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py data_dir arch hidden_units batch_size --gpu --epochs 10 --learning_rate 0.001
Example:

bash
Copy code
python train.py flowers vgg16 512 64 --gpu --epochs 10 --learning_rate 0.001
Save Checkpoints: The script will save model checkpoints in the checkpoints/ directory by default.

🔍 Predicting with the Model
Run the Prediction Script:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py image_path checkpoint --top_k 5 --category_names cat_to_name.json --gpu
Example:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py flowers/test/1/image_06752.jpg checkpoints/checkpoint.pth --top_k 5 --category_names cat_to_name.json --gpu
Output Example:

yaml
Copy code
Prediction: sunflower, Probability: 0.87
Prediction: daisy, Probability: 0.05
